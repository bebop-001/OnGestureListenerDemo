# OnGestureListenerDemo
Android Kotlin implementaton of OnGestureListener and
SimpleOnGestureListener with sample code for studying how this class works.

I found the same code on several posts around the web while trying
to understand how the Android GestureDetector worked. [The code
looks like it was part of an MIT online Android course and was
well written.](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/docs/training/gestures/detector.html)  However the project I was working on was complicated
and I needed a testbed.  This is the result.

It contains working GestureDetector  SimpleOnGestureListener,
OnGestureListener and OnDoubleTapListener implementations.  I pulled
the callbacks into separate class files so I could see how they were related.
The callbacks are set up to send messages to a text-view
so you can see what is going on.

Source is in Kotlin which I've been using for a while and like much
more than Java.

Have fun
